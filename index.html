        <h3>EXERCISE THERAPY</h3>
        <p>Physical therapy involves the performance of targeted exercises to heal painful or injured areas of the body. Treatment typically involved a combination of specific exercises, targeted stretching and weight resistance. Our therapists will design an individualized course of treatment for each patient based on a physical evaluation as well as input from your referring physician and your own personal goals for treatment. It is important to note that performing your home exercises independently will increase the recovery rate and success of your rehabilitation.</p>

            <h3>POOL THERAPY (REDMOND LOCATION)</h3>
            <p>Our facility is equipped with an underwater treadmill and warm water therapy pool that is the only one of its kind in the area. The pool allows decreased stress on joints and places added resistance to the appropriate musculature without overloading the injury site. The pool temperature is gauged to provide comfort for patients with arthritis or to allow for intense aerobic workouts without overheating. Patients who often benefit from aquatic therapy are post surgery patients, particularly hip, knee and foot surgeries. In addition to post surgery rehab, it is beneficial for stress related injuries such as shin splints, post auto injury and joint pain related to arthritis.</p>

        <h3>MANUAL THERAPY</h3>
        <p>At Premier Physical Therapy our therapists have a strong hold on manual therapy. In conjunction with a home and gym exercise program, manual therapy is an integral part of your rehabilitation. Manual therapy consists of, but is not limited to, joint mobilization, neural mobilization, soft tissue mobilization and manual resistive exercises. Our therapists are knowledgeable in a variety of techniques and will be used appropriately to fit your specific needs.</p>

            <h3>ORTHOTICS</h3>
            <p>Premier Physical Therapy offers the service of custom orthotics. Orthotics can help by controlling faulty mechanics of the hip, knee and foot/ankle complex. Abnormal joint mechanics can lead to increased joint stress and possible injury. Orthotics can help with injuries such as shin splints, plantar fasciitis and patella femoral dysfunction as related to abnormal biomechanics. In many cases a custom orthotic may not be necessary and an over the counter orthotic will be sufficient. Rest assured that your therapist will help guide you to the best option for your specific needs.</p>
